## Today's the Day (or night?)

I'm finally getting this personal site into a functional space, to post my findings large and small. I've decided to give [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a try, for a few reasons:

1. It uses Javascript and React, allowing for a pretty cool experience for a static site (in languages and frameworks I'm comfortable with!)
2. It uses GraphQL for defining schema and getting data, to do some really awesome compile-time magic and allow for dynamic data as well!
3. It was easy to get up and going, old sport!

## The Enemy of Done

It has minimal style, content, and functionality at the moment, and that's expected to change. But now that it's here, I can leverage it and make improvements over time instead of dwelling on getting it up and running!
