# Frequent Questions Series: What Does a Front-End / UI Developer Do?

#### On This Series

In my day-to-day, at meetups, with clients, whether they're other developers or friends and family, there are a lot of similar questions on everybody's minds. This series aims to address them as I notice their frequency! Check out other posts as their made here:

## So... What do you do, exactly?

As with most questions, the answer is: it depends. The position itself differs widely betwneen employers across the industery, so I'll attempt to detail some of the nuances here.


1. Build the part you interact with

 Understanding and refining / simplifying the requirements. Understanding what data is needed, and how to best retrieve it.  Implementing the vision / patterns of your fellow designers. In many cases, filling in the gaps when a designer is not available. From a technical standpoint, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Consideration of how an experience visually scales across different size devices. 

2. Advocate for the user experience

This means, at all times, considering the user's point of view. Is this a painful interaction for users? Am I considering all possible users? Are we making it easier for the user to achieve what they came here to do? Helping Business understand a more optimal experience than something proposed. Knowing when something does or does not belong

3. Code Design and Advising Fellow Developers

In a team environment, it isn't feasible for a UI Developer to be the only one touching the front-end code. It's their duty to make reusing and implementation of UI elements painless for their peers. They'll be called upon to defend user experiences and advocate for alternatives that they propose. They'll be responsible for knowing when logic doesn't belong in the front-end.

## So is it like real development?

Sometimes it's an innocent question, sometimes these are fighting words. There's been a drive in our industry lately to consider UI Development solely a Javascript venture. This misconception leads to over-engineered, inaccessible experiences all across the net. 

## What *is* UX, anyway?
